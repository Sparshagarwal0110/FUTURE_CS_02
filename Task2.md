# 🎯 FUTURE_CS_02 – Phishing Simulation Project  
📚 **Cybersecurity Internship Task** – *Future Interns Program*

## 🔍 **Objective:**  
Simulate a phishing attack using the **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)** in a lab environment to demonstrate credential harvesting techniques and raise awareness about social engineering risks.

## 🛠️ **Tools Used:**

- **Kali Linux**  
- **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**  
- **Local Network Hosting**  
- **Cloned GitHub Login Page**  

## ✅ **Steps Performed:**

1. Launched SET and selected Credential Harvester Attack via Site Cloner.
2. Cloned the GitHub login page using SET.
3. Hosted the phishing page on the local network.
4. Sent the phishing link within the LAN.
5. Captured credentials submitted through the fake page.

## 🧪 **Outcome:**

| Result                   | Description                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Phishing Page Created    | GitHub clone hosted locally                 |
| Credentials Captured     | Username and password harvested in terminal |
| Scope                    | Internal / same network                     |

## 🔐 **Security Takeaways:**

- Phishing is easy to simulate but hard to defend without user awareness.
- Credential theft can happen silently if users aren't trained.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can reduce impact.
